# ApiWebDevStart

PLEASE DO NOT PUSH ANY CHANGES, THIS IS MEANT AS A STARTING POINT FOR AN API WEBSITE.

This is a simple Javascript, Jquery, and HTML website that you can use as a resource for creating websites with API.

I added comments in app.js on all the code that you may not understand yet.
request.js will probably stay the same throughout any api websites you make, you can modify if you want to.
getEventInfo() in app.js shouldn't be touched unless you want to figure out the problem of offsetting the api so that you can add all events into it.
index.html should be modified if you wish to add more filters or make the website look fancier.

                  <<<<<<<<RESOURCES TO LOOK AT>>>>>>>>
For any Jquery help I recommend KhanAcademy to learn it. 
I found that https://api.jquery.com/ is a very good way to find specific methods in Jquery if you need to find one.
w3schools.com is good if you need help with simple Javascript/CSS/HTML 
And if you get stuck on a problem, remember google exists for a reason and StackOverFlow is godly.

If you want to read a JSON file or api link easily and without confusion use https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/
